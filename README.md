# Climate Youth Research Initiative Website

A bilingual, youth-led environmental information platform for students with an interactive mission lab, graphical impact cockpit, topic explorers, global map models, a quiz, structured article data, an article-based CYRI assistant, a protected publishing backend and responsive Apple-inspired styling. CYRI publishes educational content and does not conduct original research.

Run `npm start` and open `http://localhost:5173/` to view the site with the backend enabled.

Funding notice:
- The action! funding notice is integrated site-wide before the footer.
- The supplied RGB funding logo remains unchanged, readable and displayed on a white background with protected spacing according to the funding guidelines.
- The accompanying text names the programme “action! Aktiv für eine globale Welt” and the funding by DSEE with BMZ funds.

Student info experience:
- The `Explore` page puts interactive missions, models and environmental facts before passive reading.
- Visitors can switch between oceans, climate ecosystems and climate-ready cities.
- Mission, quiz and discovery choices are stored locally in the visitor's browser.
- The Mission Lab lets visitors combine an environmental challenge, perspective and time frame into a live info model, animated impact cockpit, field kit, mini experiment, discussion prompt and action plan.
- The SDG Lab turns all 17 Sustainable Development Goals into clickable student cards with short explanations, reflection questions and links into the map models.
- The Learning Games arcade adds five sequential games: SDG Sprint, Cause Chain, City Builder, Reef Rescue and Climate Council 2035.
- City Builder, Reef Rescue and Climate Council include local Three.js models that react to decisions without loading scripts from a third-party CDN.
- The student interface uses larger card-style controls and readable meters instead of cramped table-like rows or text-heavy circles.
- The knowledge check offers four selectable lengths with 3, 6, 9 or 12 bilingual questions, including SDG-focused prompts.
- The CYRI assistant is integrated into the `Explore` page instead of appearing as a separate navigation item.
- Each topic includes three interactive key-concept discoveries with animated explanations and locally saved discovery progress.
- The explainer workbench adds child- and youth-friendly mini tools for simple language, cause chains, global links, fact checks and short-video planning.
- The interactive world map uses clickable hotspots with scenario models for climate, biodiversity, water and justice contexts, including SDG references and Global South examples.
- A local participation poll and action cards support low-threshold youth engagement without collecting personal data.
- Articles remain the source-based foundation; infographics and social explainers are presented as additional information formats.

Backend routes:
- `GET backend.php?route=/articles` returns published articles from `data/articles.json`.
- `POST backend.php?route=/auth/publish` checks the publish password and returns a temporary session token.
- `POST backend.php?route=/translate` translates German article fields into English with OpenAI.
- `POST backend.php?route=/research` answers questions using published CYRI articles as the only content basis.
- `POST backend.php?route=/uploads` stores an optimized custom article photo in `data/uploads`.
- `POST backend.php?route=/articles` stores a new article immediately or with a future `publishAt` time.
- `POST backend.php?route=/contact` validates and rate-limits contact messages, stores a
  recoverable copy in `data/messages.json` and sends a plain-text email to the configured
  CYRI inbox.
- `/api/...` paths also work on Node and through the root Apache rewrite.

Deployment:
- Node hosting: upload the full folder, run `npm start`, and point the domain to the Node app. Set `CYRI_DATA_DIR` to a persistent server directory when the host uses ephemeral deployments.
- PHP/Apache hosting: upload the full folder. The backend logic is in one file, `backend.php`. Make sure the `data` folder is writable; runtime JSON files are created automatically. `CYRI_DATA_DIR` can point to storage outside the deployment folder.
- Static-only hosting is not enough for publishing, contact messages or AI answers, because those features need the backend.
- GitHub Pages can display the frontend, but it cannot run the CYRI assistant or store published articles. Use the Node/Docker or PHP deployment as the production website when these functions must work.

Scheduled publishing:
- Select `Schedule for later` in the protected publishing editor and choose a local date and time.
- The browser sends the time as UTC. Future articles remain hidden from the public API until their launch time.
- No cron job is required; the public article list is filtered whenever it is requested.

AI translation:
- Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the server environment. Never put the key in `app.js`, `index.html` or Git.
- The protected editor can translate the German title, summary and article text into English. Existing English fields are replaced only after clicking the translation button.
- The default model is `gpt-5.4-mini`. Override it with `OPENAI_TRANSLATION_MODEL` if needed.
- Translation requests are sent only from the Node or PHP backend. Review every translation before publishing.

Contact email delivery:
- Create a Resend account, add and verify the sending subdomain `send.cyri.online`, and add the
  SPF and DKIM records shown by Resend to the domain DNS.
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` on the server. Set `RESEND_API_KEY` to a sending-only API key,
  `CYRI_CONTACT_FROM` to an address on the verified domain and `CYRI_CONTACT_TO` to
  `climateyri@gmail.com`.
- Never place the API key in `app.js`, `index.html`, a public hosting dashboard field or Git.
- The visitor's validated address is used only as `Reply-To`; the fixed verified CYRI address is
  always used as the sender to protect deliverability and prevent mail-header injection.
- Contact requests are limited to 16 KB and five accepted attempts per IP per hour. The persistent
  rate-limit file contains only a one-way hash of the client address. A honeypot, minimum
  completion time and same-site browser check reject common automated abuse.
- Messages are stored with delivery status for recovery and automatically removed after roughly
  six months when a later contact request performs retention cleanup.
- Set `CYRI_TRUST_PROXY=true` only behind a trusted reverse proxy that overwrites
  `X-Forwarded-For`. Otherwise leave it `false` so visitors cannot spoof the rate-limit address.

CYRI assistant:
- Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the server environment. The key stays in the Node or PHP backend and is never sent to visitors.
- The backend selects up to three relevant published CYRI articles and instructs the model to answer only from that supplied material.
- Answers include links back to the CYRI articles used. Unsupported questions should receive a clear statement that the available articles do not contain enough information.
- The default model is `gpt-5.4-mini`. Override it with `OPENAI_RESEARCH_MODEL` if needed.
- Public research requests are limited to 12 questions per IP address in 10 minutes.
- Questions are transmitted to the configured AI provider. The interface tells visitors not to enter personal or confidential information.

Docker / Node server:
- Build the optimized Node image with `docker build -t cyri-website .`.
- Run it with `docker run -d --name cyri -p 5173:5173 -v cyri-data:/app/data --env-file .env cyri-website`.
- Publishing stays disabled until `CYRI_PUBLISH_PASSWORD` or a SHA-256 `CYRI_PUBLISH_PASSWORD_HASH` is configured. Never commit the production secret.
- Or use `docker compose up -d --build`; `compose.yaml` automatically mounts the named `cyri-data` volume.
- Open `http://localhost:5173/`. Published articles, uploaded photos and contact messages are stored in the `cyri-data` volume.
- Do not delete the `cyri-data` volume during updates. `docker compose down` keeps it; `docker compose down -v` deletes it.

Persistent storage:
- Articles are stored in `articles.json`; uploaded photos are stored in `uploads`.
- Every JSON update keeps a complete mirrored copy in a `.bak` file.
- If the main JSON file becomes unreadable, the backend restores it automatically from that backup.

For production, set `CYRI_PUBLISH_PASSWORD` or `CYRI_PUBLISH_PASSWORD_HASH` in the server environment. Publishing is disabled when neither value is configured.

Third-party frontend code:
- Three.js `0.185.1` is vendored in `assets/vendor/three` under the MIT License. The original license text is included beside the module.
